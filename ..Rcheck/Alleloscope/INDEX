AssignClones_ref        Using marker regions to assign each cell into c
                        reference subclones
Createobj               Generate Alleloscope object for analysis
EM                      Iterative phasing and theta_hat estimation
Est_regions             Perform EM iterations on the filtered cells
                        with barcodes, and plot the results for each
                        region.
Genotype                Genotype each cell for each region and plot the
                        genotypes.
Genotype_value          Normalize coverage using identified/ specified
                        normal cells and one normal region and generate
                        a table with (rho_hat, theta_hat) of each cell
                        for all regions.
Lineage_plot            Generate genotype plot (scatter plot) for each
                        region and save in the plot directory.
Matrix_filter           Filter object based on cell number for each
                        SNP, SNP number for each cell, SNP variant
                        allele frequency, and exclude the centromere
                        and telomere regions.
Rundf_dna               Run all steps for scDNA-seq data
Segmentation            HMM segmentation based on coverage matrix for
                        paired tumor and normal sample.
Segments_filter         Select the segments in the "seg_table" with
                        more than nSNP
Select_normal           Identify candidate normal cells and normal
                        regions for cell coverage normalization
genotype_conf           Compute confidence scores based on posterior
                        probability for each cell in a region.
